# AI Labs
In this repo I place solutions to my artificial intelligence labs that I made during my studies. I write code in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [JetBrains DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/)

## Lab 1 - Regression
In first laboratories task was to:
- Calculate closed-form solution for given dataset using [numpy](https://numpy.org/) matrices
- Do a linear regression in iterative method using mean square error function gradient

## Lab 2 - ...
